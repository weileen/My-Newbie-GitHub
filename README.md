# My-Newbie-GitHub
To learn GitHub is an exciting learning experience for me as I can keep up with the technology trend on opensources while I can apply the knowledge to my work assignment hopefully.
I start this learning on 12/07/2016. Here are some steps involved:
  1. First I have to have a GitHub account 
  2. Log/access my GitHub account
  3. Create a "New Repository"  which is named as "My-Newbie-GitHub"
  4. Edit and commit the README.md file
  5. Create a new branch from the default "Master" branch "My-Edit"
  6. Update this README.md file with my steps 
  7. Click on Commit Changes button to commit my changes with this README.md file
